# PBWM-Project

INTRODUCTION 
The goal of this challenge is to reinforce the technical skills taught during the training program, and to provide an opportunity to use 
the technology in the development of a typical real-world type of business application. 

OBJECTIVES 
During this challenge, you will be required to perform the design, implementation and testing necessary to build a representative 
application for use within Citi using a typical technology stack.  
Successful completion of the challenge will require: 
• The development of an application that meets the Application Specification provided below. 
• The application must include: 
1. A usable-front end, built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, React, or Angular the choice is up to your group. 
2. A functioning back-end, using Spring Boot. 
3. Storage and retrieval of data from a MongoDB database. 
4. A well-designed REST API for the front-end and other potential clients to connect to. 
5. Runnable tests to aid with future development. 
• You will also prepare a demonstration to be presented to peers, instructors, and existing senior staff on Friday August 18.

BUILD SCHEDULE 
The expected work schedule is as follows. 
August 9 – Populate a MongoDB database with credit card user data & create a simple API to expose some of the data. 
August 11 – Refine the API to allow users to create, read, update and delete (CRUD). 
August 17 – Design and implement a HTML/CSS/JS, React, or Angular user interface to interact with the API. 
August 18 – Demonstrate the application. 
If time permits deploy the REST API in a container or container orchestration platform using a pipeline. 
Security and authentication are not required.
